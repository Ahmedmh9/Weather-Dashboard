# Weather-Dashboard

This is an application that find weather conditions on the city you search and it give you the current and the next 5 days forecast.

Tasks:
Third-party APIs allow developers to access their data and functionality by making requests with specific parameters to a URL.
Your challenge is to build a weather dashboard that will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS.


GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs
WHEN I search for a city
THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index
WHEN I view the UV index
THEN I am presented with a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe
WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, and the humidity.
